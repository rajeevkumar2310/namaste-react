What is npm?
NPM is a package manager. It is not an abbreviation for Node package manager.

What is parcel/Webpack?
Parcel and webpack are npm packages which do a lot of things like
Dev Build
Local server
HMR: Hot Module Replacement
File watching algorithm -- written in C++
Caching - Faster Builds
Image optimization
Minification
Bundling
Compression
Consistent Hashing
Code Splitting
Differential Bundling - to support older browsers
Diagnostics
Good Error Handling
Https
Tree Shaking - removes unused code
Different build for Dev and Production


what is .parcel-cache?
parcel-cache is where parcel package caches our app into binary files from which rebuilds can happen efficiently.

what is npx?
npx is used to execute a package.
example: npx parcel index.html

what are the differences between dependencies and devDependencies?
Dev dependencies are for development environments and dependencies are for production environments.

what is Treeshaking?
Treeshaking is something that our bundler package like parcel does which 
shakes off the unused code in our app. So it is called tree shaking.

What is HMR?
As you make changes to your code, Parcel automatically rebuilds the changed files 
and updates your app in the browser. By default, Parcel fully reloads the page,
but in some cases it may perform Hot Module Replacement (HMR). HMR improves the development 
experience by updating modules in the browser at runtime without needing a whole page refresh. 
This means that application state can be retained as you change small things in your code.
When we change code, and save it, it immediately reflects in our webpage. This is HMR.

what is .gitignore? What should we add and not add into it?
.gitignore is a file where we add file names that are not required/recreatable.
If the document or file is recreatable, it is not required for such document to push to git hub.
So we include its name to gitignore. files listed in .gitignore are ignored and not pushed to git hub.
Files that are needed by the app and are not recreatable should be pushed to git hub. Such files 
should not be added to .gitignore.


what is the difference between package.json and package-lock.json?
Package.json contains dependencies and devDependencies approximate versions/ version ranges.
Package-lock.json contains exact versions of the dependencies/devDependencies along with Hash value
so that same package is available in both development and production.

Why should I not modify package-lock.json?
we should not modify package-lock.json because it contains exact versions of the dependencies/devDependencies
along with Hash value that maintains consistency among various environments.

what is the dist folder?
Dist folder is generated once we run npx parcel build index.html and 
contains production build files. This folder is recreatable.
The "dist" folder typically contains the following:

Minified and optimized JavaScript files.
Minified and optimized CSS files.
Any static assets like images or fonts that your application uses.
An HTML file (usually "index.html") that serves as the entry point to your application.

What is browserlists?
browserslist is a configuration file or setting used by various front-end tools, 
including Babel and Autoprefixer, to specify the list of target browsers and their versions
that your project should support. This configuration helps these tools determine how to transpile
and prefix CSS and JavaScript code to ensure compatibility with the specified browsers.
