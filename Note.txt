package.json is a configuration for npm

There are two types of dependencies which our app can have
1. dev dependencies
2. normal dependencies

difference between caret and tilde in package.json

package-lock.json:
keeps track of exact version of package that was installed

transitive dependencies:
example: parcel is what we install.
it can have some dependencies. Those dependencies will have their own dependencies
those dependencies can have their own dependencies
This is called transitive dependencies

if we have package.json and package-lock.json,
we can recreate node_modules


just like we have npm, we have something called npx
npx means executing a package
npm is for installing a package.

npm intall parcel
npx parcel index.html


cdn links is not a preferred way to bring react into our app
