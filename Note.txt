package.json is a configuration for npm

There are two types of dependencies which our app can have
1. dev dependencies
2. normal dependencies

difference between caret and tilde in package.json

package-lock.json:
keeps track of exact version of package that was installed

transitive dependencies:
example: parcel is what we install.
it can have some dependencies. Those dependencies will have their own dependencies
those dependencies can have their own dependencies
This is called transitive dependencies

if we have package.json and package-lock.json,
we can recreate node_modules
